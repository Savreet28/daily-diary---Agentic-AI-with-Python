# LOOPS : # A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code multiple times.
# It allows you to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or execute a block of code multiple times based on a condition.
# There are two main types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.

# FOR LOOP : A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object.
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# WHILE LOOP : A while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# break and continue
# break → Exit the loop

# continue → Skip current iteration

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
