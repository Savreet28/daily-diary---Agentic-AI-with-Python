# object oriented programming structures in python

"""  1. In real world
        Object
            Anything which exists is an object
            A real thing
            An entity
        Class
            Drawing of an object

        Principle of OOPS
        1. Think of an Object
        2. Create its Representation/drawing i.e. Class
        3. From Class create a real object

    2. in computer science
        Object
            is a storage container (Box)
            which we can customize as per our requirements

        Class
            textual representation of object
            i.e. we code to create a class

Principle of OOPS : From Class create a real object
