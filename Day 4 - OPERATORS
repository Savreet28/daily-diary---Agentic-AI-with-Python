# Controller: Operators

# Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, **, //, %
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
# They include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, floor division, and modulus.
# These operators can be used with integers and floating-point numbers.

#example:

cab_fare = 1000
taxes = 0.18
tax_to_pay = cab_fare * taxes

amount_to_pay = cab_fare + tax_to_pay

print('tax_to_pay is:', tax_to_pay)
print('amount_to_pay is:', amount_to_pay)

number1 = 10
number2 = 3
# result = number1 / number2 # floating point division
result = number1 // number2  # integral division
print('result:', result)

number3 = 2
number4 = 4
number5 = number3 ** number4
print('number5:', number5)

# Number System -> Explore it, if you do not know it
print(number1)
print(bin(number1))
print(oct(number1))
print(hex(number1))

-------

# Conditional Operators : >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

cab_fare = 1000
e_wallet = 1000

can_cab_be_booked = e_wallet >= cab_fare

# print("can i book cab: ", cab_fare < e_wallet)
print("can i book cab: ", can_cab_be_booked)
print(type(can_cab_be_booked))
