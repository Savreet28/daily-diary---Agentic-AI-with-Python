# TUPLE :
# collection of ordered elements
# immutable- once created their values cannot be changed


# Define a tuple of names
names = ('phoebe', 'monica', 'rachel')

# Access one name to demonstrate variables and types
name = names[0]

# Print details
print(name, type(name), id(name))         # Single name (string)
print(names, type(names), id(names))      # The whole tuple
print(names[0], type(names[0]), id(names[0]))  # First element of tuple
